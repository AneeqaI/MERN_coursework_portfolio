# Week 9 – React Class Components and State Management

This task focuses on developing interactive user interface components using React class components. The objective of the lab was to understand how state is managed within class components, how constructors and render methods are used, and how event handlers update component state without relying on React Hooks.

## Technologies Used
- React
- JavaScript (ES6)
- JSX
- Node.js
- Visual Studio Code

## Task Overview
- Created React class components by extending `React.Component`
- Implemented constructors to initialise component state
- Used the `render()` method to control UI output
- Managed component state using `this.state` and `this.setState`
- Implemented event handlers bound to class methods
- Built a Facebook-style emoji counter component that tracks click events
- Passed properties (props) to class components to control behaviour and output
- Rendered multiple instances of a class component with different props
- Implemented a toggle component that switches between emoji states on user interaction

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Differences between functional and class-based components
- State management in class components
- Use of constructors and method binding
- Handling user events in React class components
- Conditional rendering based on component state
- Component reuse through props

## Files Included
- `Facebookemoji.js` – Class component implementing an emoji counter with internal state
- `ToggleModeComponent.js` – Class component demonstrating state-based toggling behaviour
- `index.js` – Entry point rendering multiple class components
- Image assets used by the components (e.g. like, love, happy, sad)
- Supporting CSS files for styling

## Evidence
- All React source files for the completed tasks are included in this directory
- Application behaviour was verified in the browser using `npm start`
- Screenshots demonstrating component interaction and state changes are included in the Word portfolio
