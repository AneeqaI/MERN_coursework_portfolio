# Week 5 – React Functional Components and Hooks

This task focuses on building interactive user interface components using React functional components and Hooks. The lab introduces state management with `useState`, side effects with `useEffect`, and passing data through props to create reusable and dynamic components.

## Technologies Used
- React
- JavaScript (ES6)
- JSX
- Node.js
- React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Visual Studio Code

## Task Overview
- Created a React application using `create-react-app`
- Developed functional components using modern React syntax
- Implemented state management with the `useState` hook
- Built a click counter component to track user interactions
- Created an emoji counter component that updates dynamically based on props
- Imported and displayed images within React components
- Used the `useEffect` hook to update component state in response to prop changes
- Rendered multiple components with different properties in the main application
- Built an interactive mood-based widget that combines counters, images, and user interaction

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Functional components in React
- State management using Hooks
- Handling user events in React
- Using props to create reusable components
- Dynamic rendering of images
- Managing side effects with `useEffect`
- Component composition and reusability

## Files Included
- `src/index.js` – Application entry point rendering multiple components
- `src/Counter.js` – Click counter component using `useState`
- `src/EmojeeCounters.js` – Emoji counter component using `useState` and `useEffect`
- Image assets used by components (e.g. Love, Like, Sad)
- Supporting CSS files for styling

## Evidence
- All React source files for the completed tasks are included in this directory
- The application was tested using `npm start`
