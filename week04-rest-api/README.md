# Week 4 – REST API Development with Node.js and Express

This task focuses on building a basic REST API using Node.js and the Express framework. The objective of the lab was to understand how RESTful routes operate, how data can be passed using URL parameters and HTTP methods, and how JSON data can be read and processed on the server.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Node.js Core Modules (fs)
- Body-parser middleware
- HTML (for POST form submission)

## Task Overview
- Created a basic Express web application and configured a local server
- Implemented GET routes to handle simple requests and URL parameters
- Used route parameters to retrieve dynamic values from URLs
- Applied middleware to parse incoming form data
- Created and read a JSON file using the Node.js `fs` module
- Implemented REST endpoints to retrieve all student records and individual records by ID
- Built an HTML form and handled POST requests to process submitted user data

## Files Included
- `index.js` – Main Express server file containing routes and middleware
- `Student.json` – JSON file containing student records
- `StudentInfo.html` – HTML form used to submit data via POST request

## Evidence
- All source files for the REST API implementation are included in this directory
- API responses were tested using a web browser and verified through terminal output
- Screenshots of application output are included in the Word portfolio
