# Week 7 – MongoDB CRUD Operations with Node.js and Mongoose

This task focuses on integrating MongoDB CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations into a Node.js application using Mongoose. The objective of the lab was to demonstrate how database interactions can be performed programmatically rather than directly through the MongoDB shell or Compass.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Visual Studio Code

## Task Overview
- Initialised a Node.js project using npm
- Installed and configured Mongoose for MongoDB integration
- Established a connection to a local MongoDB database
- Defined a schema and model using Mongoose
- Created single and multiple documents programmatically
- Queried documents using different filtering criteria
- Sorted and limited query results
- Counted the total number of documents in a collection
- Updated multiple documents using conditional queries
- Deleted documents based on specified conditions
- Used promises (`.then()` and `.catch()`) to handle asynchronous database operations

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Programmatic database connectivity using Mongoose
- Schema and model creation
- CRUD operations within an application context
- Use of callbacks and promises for error handling
- Query filtering, sorting, and aggregation techniques
- Managing and updating collections dynamically

## Files Included
- `index.js` – Main Node.js application file containing database connection, schema definition, and CRUD operations
- `package.json` – Project configuration and dependencies

## Evidence
- All required MongoDB CRUD operations are implemented in the source code
- Database changes were verified using MongoDB Compass
