# Week 5 – React Fundamentals and Functional Components

This task introduces the fundamentals of React programming, focusing on creating user interfaces using functional components. The lab demonstrates how React applications are structured, how components are rendered, and how properties and events are used to control component behaviour.

## Technologies Used
- React
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js
- JSX
- Visual Studio Code

## Task Overview
- Created a React application using `create-react-app`
- Explored the structure of a React project, including `public` and `src` directories
- Modified JSX content to dynamically change text displayed in the browser
- Applied CSS styling to update the background colour of the application
- Created functional React components
- Implemented components using properties (props) to control output
- Rendered custom components using `ReactDOM.render`
- Created reusable components with different property values
- Implemented click events within functional components
- Built interactive components that respond to user input and button events

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- JSX syntax and embedding JavaScript expressions
- Functional components and component reusability
- Passing and accessing props in components
- Event handling in React
- Component rendering lifecycle
- Separation of concerns using multiple component files

## Files Included
- `src/App.js` – Main application component
- `src/index.js` – Entry point responsible for rendering components
- Custom component files such as:
  - `myGreetingApp.js`
  - `myGreetingProp.js`
  - `AppbackgroundColor.js`
- CSS files for component and global styling

## Evidence
- All React source files for the completed tasks are included in this directory
- Application output was verified in the browser using `npm start`
- Screenshots demonstrating component rendering and interaction are included in the Word portfolio
