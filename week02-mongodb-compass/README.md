# Week 2 – MongoDB Compass

This task focuses on the use of MongoDB Compass to perform core database operations and basic data analysis within a NoSQL environment. The objective of the task was to demonstrate an understanding of how MongoDB stores, manages, and queries document-based data without the use of fixed schemas.

## Tools Used
- MongoDB Compass
- MongoDB (Local)

## Task Overview
- Created a new MongoDB database and collections
- Inserted, updated, and deleted documents using CRUD operations
- Explored data structure and document-based storage
- Utilised the aggregation pipeline with stages such as `$match` and `$group`
- Performed basic analytical calculations including average, minimum, and maximum values

## Evidence
- Exported JSON files of collections are included in the `exports` directory
- Screenshots demonstrating database structure, documents, and aggregation queries are included in the `screenshots` directory
