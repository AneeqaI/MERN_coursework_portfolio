# Week 3 – JavaScript Modules and Node.js

This task focuses on understanding how JavaScript functions and modules operate within a Node.js environment. The lab introduces core JavaScript concepts alongside Node.js features, including local modules, arrow functions, and built-in core modules.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Node.js Core Modules (os, util)
- Visual Studio Code

## Task Overview
- Created and executed JavaScript files using Node.js
- Defined and invoked standard JavaScript functions with parameters
- Implemented arrow functions for more concise function definitions
- Created local modules and exported functions, variables, and objects
- Imported local modules using the `require` keyword
- Implemented a class using the `class` and `constructor` keywords
- Utilised Node.js core modules to retrieve system information such as operating system details, memory usage, CPU information, and network interfaces

## Files Included
- `index.js` – Main file used to execute functions and import modules
- `StudentInfo.js` – Local module exporting functions and variables
- `Person.js` – Module demonstrating class-based object creation
- Exercise 4 implementation using Node.js core modules

## Evidence
- All JavaScript source files for the completed exercises are included in this directory
- Terminal output screenshots demonstrating successful execution are included in the Word portfolio
